# Hi I'm Quinn
I'm an Aspiring Programmer Game Dev and Cybersecurity Proffesional I've been programming ever since June of 2023 and interested in technology since August 2020.
# Why I started programming?
I started programming as a way to create things and use my time wasted idle doing something productive instead.
# How'd you get into programming?
I got into programming because I love everything involving comupters and programming for them is a great way to continue getting involved in everything technology.
# Do you enjoy programming?
Yes. And no. Sometimes it's frustating sometimes its statisfying seeing somehting you've made go in the way that you intended to but most of the times it doesn't and you have to change it up a bit. It's bascially just like the game Dark Souls in a way
# What languages do you know?
English. A little bit of C#. Basic Python and GDScript. I mostly know GDScript since Game Devolpment is what i'm focusing on now
# What free resources do you recommend
[learnpython.org](https://learnpython.org),  [learnhtml.org](https://www.learn-html.org/),  [Microsofts' own learn C# resources](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp) and [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/) They're pretty beginner-friendly with online interactive courses. Also [Youtube](https://youtube.com) is also a good resource aswell.
# What things do you do besides programming?
I usually write fictional narratives in my diary. And I draw on my Lenovo Thinkpad L12 Yoga which I use for school and programming. Although I have a faster computer(HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 2020), I use it because its's lightweight and has a better screen than that and it's made for productivity.
# What operating system do you use?
I use Arch Linux Rolling on all of my computers (I dual-boot it with ReviOS (an open-sourced modified version of Windows 10 without the bloat and spyware) on my gaming laptop). I use it because it's fast and has everything that I would want out of an operating system and it's free and open-source, doesn't use that much battery and very customiseable, unlike Windows and it has a better community and has better software and app stores. I also use the GNOME and KDE desktop environments. I use KDE when my battery is low on my Lenovo Thinkpad since it's lighter-weight than GNOME and it also has lower brightness settings than GNOME (I'm using it right now because my battery is at 10%)
# What sort of software do you use?
I mostly use Libre software instead of their proprietary counter-parts. I only use proprietary software when there's no open-sourced equivilents to them, and if it's just a simple program I just launch my Windows 10 Virtual Machine and launch it there because if I can't insepct your code. I can't trust you.
