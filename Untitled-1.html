<h1 id="hi-i-m-quinn">Hi I&#39;m Quinn</h1>
<p>I&#39;m an Aspiring Programmer Game Dev and Cybersecurity Proffesional I&#39;ve been programming ever since June of 2023 and interested in technology since August 2020.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-started-programming-">Why I started programming?</h1>
<p>I started programming as a way to create things and use my time wasted idle doing something productive instead.</p>
<h1 id="how-d-you-get-into-programming-">How&#39;d you get into programming?</h1>
<p>I got into programming because I love everything involving comupters and programming for them is a great way to continue getting involved in everything technology.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-enjoy-programming-">Do you enjoy programming?</h1>
<p>Yes. And no. Sometimes it&#39;s frustating sometimes its statisfying seeing somehting you&#39;ve made go in the way that you intended to but most of the times it doesn&#39;t and you have to change it up a bit. It&#39;s bascially just like the game Dark Souls in a way</p>
<h1 id="what-languages-do-you-know-">What languages do you know?</h1>
<p>English. A little bit of C#. Basic Python and GDScript. I mostly know GDScript since Game Devolpment is what i&#39;m focusing on now</p>
<h1 id="what-free-resources-do-you-recommend">What free resources do you recommend</h1>
<p><a href="https://learnpython.org">learnpython.org</a>,  <a href="https://www.learn-html.org/">learnhtml.org</a>,  <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp">Microsofts&#39; own learn C# resources</a> and <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/">GDQuest</a> They&#39;re pretty beginner-friendly with online interactive courses. Also <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a> is also a good resource aswell.</p>
<h1 id="what-things-do-you-do-besides-programming-">What things do you do besides programming?</h1>
<p>I usually write fictional narratives in my diary. And I draw on my Lenovo Thinkpad L12 Yoga which I use for school and programming. Although I have a faster computer(HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop 2020), I use it because its&#39;s lightweight and has a better screen than that and it&#39;s made for productivity.</p>
<h1 id="what-operating-system-do-you-use-">What operating system do you use?</h1>
<p>I use Arch Linux Rolling on all of my computers (I dual-boot it with ReviOS (an open-sourced modified version of Windows 10 without the bloat and spyware) on my gaming laptop). I use it because it&#39;s fast and has everything that I would want out of an operating system and it&#39;s free and open-source, doesn&#39;t use that much battery and very customiseable, unlike Windows and it has a better community and has better software and app stores. I also use the GNOME and KDE desktop environments. I use KDE when my battery is low on my Lenovo Thinkpad since it&#39;s lighter-weight than GNOME and it also has lower brightness settings than GNOME (I&#39;m using it right now because my battery is at 10%)</p>
<h1 id="what-sort-of-software-do-you-use-">What sort of software do you use?</h1>
<p>I mostly use Libre software instead of their proprietary counter-parts. I only use proprietary software when there&#39;s no open-sourced equivilents to them, and if it&#39;s just a simple program I just launch my Windows 10 Virtual Machine and launch it there because if I can&#39;t insepct your code. I can&#39;t trust you.</p>
